Ok.
1. Remove "Sample.jpg" and replace it with your own.(I believe this will only work with JPG)
2. Now go to line 23 of the "Generator.py" script. (open this with a text editor of your choice)
THIS LINE -----> im = Image.open("Sample.jpg")
3.Now replace it -----> im = Image.open("File Name.jpg")
"File Name" needs to be you file you placed earlier.
4. Run the script.
5. Open the new txt file.
Done
